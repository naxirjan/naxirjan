# NAZIR AHMED - Senior Software Engineer
I am a senior software engineer, specializing in the website and mobile apps development. 
For the last 4 years, I have been developing websites and mobile apps using PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, React Native and other programming languages & frameworks.
I'm passionate about software development and I'm looking forward to getting to work on new projects in the near future.
Something that I love about software development is the opportunity to work with people from a wide range of disciplines. 

If you want to talk about software development, coding or anything else, drop me a line. I am always eager to hear from others and expand my network on LinkedIn.
